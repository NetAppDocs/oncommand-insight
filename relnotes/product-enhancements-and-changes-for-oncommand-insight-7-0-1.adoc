As part of your installation and configuration planning, you should verify that the devices in your environment can be monitored by Insight. You should check the OnCommand Insight interoperability matrix and data source support matrix for details about operating systems, specific devices, and protocols. Refer to the _OnCommand Insight Installation Guide_ to view these matrices.

== New beta data sources

Violin Memory

== Removed data sources

EMC Connectrix 7: Any instances of this data source and its associated data are removed during the upgrade.

== Data source enhancements

The OnCommand Insight7.0 release provides new data source management tools that enable you to rapidly set up and easily maintain your data sources.

The Insight data source wizard simplifies your data source setup process by listing the essential setup information in the Configuration section and the less significant setup details in the Advanced Configuration section. You can find descriptions of all possible setup information in the _OnCommand Insight Configuration and Administration Guide_ and in the web UI Help.
