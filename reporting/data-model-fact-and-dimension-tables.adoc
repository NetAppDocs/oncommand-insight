Each data model includes both fact and dimension tables.

* Fact tables: Contain data that is measured, for example, quantity, raw and usable capacity. Contain foreign keys to dimension tables.
* Dimension tables: Contain descriptive information about facts, for example, data center and business units. A dimension is a structure, often composed of hierarchies, that categorizes data. Dimensional attributes help describe the dimensional values.

Using different or multiple dimension attributes (seen as columns in the reports), you construct reports that access data for each dimension described in the data model.

For explanations of all data elements used in creating reports, see the Data Glossary.
