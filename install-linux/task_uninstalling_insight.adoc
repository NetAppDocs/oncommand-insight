You can uninstall the OnCommand Insight server if needed.

== Before you begin

Best practice: before uninstalling Insight, back up the OnCommand Insight database.

== Steps

. Log in to the OnCommand Insight server using an account with sudo privileges.
. Ensure that any OnCommand Insight windows are closed.
. You can view syntax, command arguments, and parameter usage for `oci-uninstall.sh` by entering the following command:
+
`sudo /usr/bin/oci-uninstall.sh --help`
+
A normal uninstall does not remove the Insight license or any daily backups. To remove the entire installation, use the `--purge` optioon with the``oci-install.sh`` command.

. Type the following command:
+
`sudo /usr/bin/oci-uninstall.sh`
