You can build from history, omitting any failed builds by enabling the *Skip history build failures* option.

If you do this, the build from history continues. If a build fails and this option is enabled, Data Warehouse continues building and ignores any failed builds. In such cases, there is no data point in the historical data for any skipped builds. If you do not enable this option and the build fails, all subsequent jobs are aborted.
