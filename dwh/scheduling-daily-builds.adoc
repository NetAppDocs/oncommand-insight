Although you can manually build Data Warehouse by using the Build now control at any time, it is best practice to schedule automatic builds, defining when and how often to build the Data Warehouse database. Data Warehouse performs a build job for each connector and for each data mart. Data Warehouse performs a build job for each connector for licenses and inventory and all other build jobs (for example, capacity) are performed on the consolidated database.

== About this task

Whenever the Data Warehouse is built, it performs an inventory job for every connector. After the inventory jobs are complete, Data Warehouse performs jobs for dimensions, capacity, and the remaining data marts.

== Steps

. Log in to the Data Warehouse Portal at `+https://hostname/dwh+`, where `hostname` is the name of the system where OnCommand Insight Data Warehouse is installed.
. From the navigation pane on the left, click *Edit Schedule*.
