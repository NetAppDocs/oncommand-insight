You must complete a series of steps to assign users to business entities. Data Warehouse accommodates multiple tenancy (often shortened to "`multi-tenancy`" or "`multitenancy`") in reporting by allowing you to associate users with one or more business entities. This enables administrators to separate data or reports according to user attributes or user affiliation.

== Steps

. Log in to the Data Warehouse Portal as administrator at `+https://hostname/dwh+`, where `hostname` is the name of the system where OnCommand Insight Data Warehouse is installed.
. On the Data Warehouse toolbar, click image:../media/oci_reporting_portal_icon.gif[] to open the Reporting Portal.
. Enter your user name and password and click *Login*.
. From the Launch menu, select *IBM Cognos Administration*.
. Click the *Security* tab:
. In the Directory, select *Cognos*.
. Create a new subfolder in the Cognos folder called "`BEs`", for business entities.
. Open the BEs folder.
. Click the *New Group* icon to add groups that correspond to different permission levels.
+
These permission levels can be either the full name of the business entity (for example, NetApp.N/A) or a prefix (for example, NetApp.N/A.Finance). Either of these formats enables access to all projects within the business entity (NetApp.N/A.Finance).
+
The New Group wizard displays.

. Complete the pages of the wizard.
. Select a business entity and click *More*.
. Click *Set members*.
. Click *Add*.
. Select the SANscreen directory.
. From the list of users, select each user that you want to include in the Business Entity and add the user to the Selected Entries box.
. Click *OK*.
. Repeat the process of adding members to each of the business entity groups.
