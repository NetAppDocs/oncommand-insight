If you cannot see annotations in Data Warehouse, you might need to force an update of annotations and then initiate a Data Warehouse build.

Missing annotations affect the way data is imported into Data Warehouse and is displayed in the reports. For example, if the annotation "`Tier`" is not available, you will not be able to group storage systems by tier in Data Warehouse reports.
