After your first build, sometimes you might encounter an unsuccessful build. To ensure that all the jobs after an unsuccessful build complete successfully, you can enable the *Skip history build failures* option.

== About this task

If a build fails and the *Skip history build failures* option is enabled, Data Warehouse continues building and ignores any failed builds. If this occurs, there will not be a data point in the historical data for any skipped builds.

Use this option only if the build is not successful.

If a build fails in Build from History and the *Skip history build failures* check box is not selected, all subsequent jobs are aborted.

== Steps

. Log in to the Data Warehouse Portal at `+https://hostname/dwh+`, where `hostname` is the name of the system where OnCommand Insight Data Warehouse is installed.
. From the navigation pane on the left, click *Build from history*.

. Click *Configure*.
. Configure the build.
. Click *Save*.
. To skip failed builds, check *Skip history build failures*.
+
You can see this check box only if the *Run* button is enabled.

. To perform a build outside of the automatic scheduled build, click *Run*.
