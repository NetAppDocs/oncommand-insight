Insight sends information to NetApp Customer Support automatically through the ASUP system you set up after installing the software. However, you might want to create a troubleshooting report and open a case with the Support team for a specific problem.

You can use tools in Insight to perform a manual Insight backup, bundle the logs, and send that information to NetApp Customer Support.
