You can edit existing and default performance policies to change how Insight monitors the conditions of interest to you in your network. For example, you might want to change a policy's threshold.

== Steps

. Open Insight in your browser.
. From the *Manage* menu, select *Performance Policies*.
+
The Performance Policies page displays.

. Hover your cursor over a policy name in an object's performance policy list.
. Click image:../media/oci-edit-threshold-policy-icon.gif[].
+
The Edit Policy dialog box displays.

. Make the required changes.
+
If you change any option other than the policy name, Insight deletes all existing violations for that policy.

. Click *Save.*
