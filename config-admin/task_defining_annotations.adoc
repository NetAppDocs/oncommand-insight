When customizing OnCommand Insight to track data for your corporate requirements, you can define any specialized annotations needed to provide a complete picture of your data: for example, asset end of life, data center, building location, storage tier, or volume, and internal volume service level.

== Steps

. List any industry terminology to which environment data must be associated.
. List corporate terminology to which environment data must be associated, which is not already being tracked using the business entities.
. Identify any default annotation types that you might be able to use.
. Identify which custom annotations you need to create.
