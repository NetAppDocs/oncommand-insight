Special variables on an asset's "Additional data" customizable page allow you to easily showcase additional information that is directly related to the current asset.

== About this task

To use the "`$this`" variables in widgets on your asset's customizable landing page, follow the steps below. For this example, we will add a table widget.

[NOTE]
====
"`$this`" variables are only valid for an asset's customizable landing page. They are not available for other Insight dashboards. The available "`$this`" variables varies according to asset type.
====

== Steps

. Navigate to an asset page for an asset of your choosing. For this example, let's choose a Virtual Machine (VM) asset page. Query or search for a VM and click on the link to go to that VM's asset page.
+
The asset page for the VM opens.

. Click on the *Change view:* > *Additional Virtual Machine data* drop-down to go to that asset's customizable landing page.
. Click on the *Widget* button and choose *Table widget*.
+
The Table widget opens for editing. By default, all storages are shown in the table.

. We want to show all virtual machines. Click on the asset selector and change *Storage* to *Virtual Machine*.
+
All virtual machines are now shown in the table.

. Click on the *Column selector* buttonimage:../media/column_picker_button.gif[]and add the *hypervisor name* field to the table.
+
The hypervisor name is shown for each VM in the table.

. We only care about the hypervisor that hosts the current VM. Click on the *Filter by* field's**+**button and select *hypervisor name*.
. Click on *Any* and select the *$this.host.name* variable. Click the check button to save the filter.
+

. The table now shows all the VM's hosted by the current VM's hypervisor. Click *Save*.

== Results

The table that you created for this virtual machine asset page will be displayed for any VM asset page you display. The use of the *$this.host.name* variable in the widget means that only the VM's owned by the current assets's hypervisor will be displayed in the table.
