You might want to change the name, description, or values for an annotation, or delete an annotation that you no longer want to use.

== Steps

. Log in to the OnCommand Insightweb UI.
. Click *Manage* and select *Annotations*.
+
The Annotations page displays.

. Position your cursor over the annotation you want to edit and click image:../media/edit_recipient_icon.gif[].
+
The *Edit Annotation* dialog box displays.

. You can make the following modifications to an annotation:
 .. Change the name, description, or both.
+
However, note that you can enter a maximum of 255 characters for both the name and description, and you cannot change the type of any annotation. Additionally, for system-level annotations, you cannot change the name or description; however, you can add or remove values if the annotation is a list type.
+
[NOTE]
====
If a custom annotation is published to the Data Warehouse and you rename it, you will lose historical data.
====

 .. To add another value to an annotation of list type, click image:../media/add_annotation_icon.gif[].
 .. To remove a value from an annotation of list type, click image:../media/trash_can_query.gif[].
+
You cannot delete an annotation value if that value is associated with an annotation contained in an annotation rule, query, or performance policy.
. Click *Save* when you finish.

== After you finish

If you are going to use annotations in the Data Warehouse, you need to force an update of annotations in the Data Warehouse. Refer to the _OnCommand Insight Data Warehouse Administration Guide_.
