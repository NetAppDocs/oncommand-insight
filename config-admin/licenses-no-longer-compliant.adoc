If you notice the "Not Compliant" message on your Insight Licenses page, Insight is managing more terabytes than your company licensed.

The "Not Compliant" message means your company paid for fewer terabytes than Insight is currently managing. The difference between the managed terabytes and the licensed number of terabytes is shown beside the non-compliance message.

The operation of your Insight system is not affected, but you should contact your NetApp representative to increase your license coverage and update the appropriate license.
