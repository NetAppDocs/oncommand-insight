The Summary section on an asset page displays a summary of information about the particular asset and shows issues related to the asset, indicated by a red circle, with hyperlinks to additional information about related assets and to any performance policies assigned to the asset.

The following example shows some of the types of information available in the Summary section of an asset page for a virtual machine. Any item with a solid red circle next to it indicates potential issues with the monitored environment.
