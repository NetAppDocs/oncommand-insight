"Configuration error" with error message "`REST Service is disabled`"

Verify REST service is enabled on this device.

Likely due to certain roles (for example, 'advanced_analytics') are not included for the configured user <userName>.Possible Solution:

* Correct the Analytics (statistic) scope for the user $\{user} with the read only role:- From the Configuration â†’ Users screen, put your mouse over the role and double click to allow editing

* Select "Analytics" from the Scope drop down menu. A list of the possible properties appears.
* Click the top most check box and it will select all three properties.- Click the Add button on the right side.
* Click the Apply button at the top right of the pop-up window. The pop-up window will close.
