Using the clone facility, you can quickly add a data source that has the same credentials and attributes as another data source. Cloning allows you to easily configure multiple instances of the same device type.

== Steps

. On the Insight toolbar, click *Admin*.
+
The Data sources list opens.

. Highlight the data source that has the setup information you want to use for your new data source.
. To the right of the highlighted data source, click the *Clone* icon.
+
The Clone this data source dialog box lists the information you must supply for the selected data source, as shown in this example for a NetApp data source:
+

. Enter the required information in the fields; those details cannot be copied from the existing data source.
. Click *Clone*.

== Results

The clone operation copies all other attributes and settings to create the new data source.
