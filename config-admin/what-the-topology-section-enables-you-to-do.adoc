The Topology section enables you to view how the assets in your network are connected to each other and display information about related assets.

== Steps

. Log in to the OnCommand Insight web UI.
. Locate an asset page by doing either of the following:
 ** On the Insight toolbar, click image:../media/icon-sanscreen-magnifying-glass-gif.gif[], type in the name of the asset, and then select the asset from the list.
 ** Click *Dashboards*, select *Assets Dashboard*, locate an asset name, and click it.
The asset page displays. You can find the Topology section in the upper right-hand corner of the asset page.

+
If the topology for the asset is larger than will fit in the section, click the *Click link to see the topology* hyperlink.
. To view more information about the base asset's related assets, position your cursor over a related asset in the topology and click its name, which displays its asset page.
