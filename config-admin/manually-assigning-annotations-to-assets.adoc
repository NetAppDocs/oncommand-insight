Assigning annotations to assets helps you sort, group, and report on assets in ways that are relevant to your business. Although you can assign annotations to assets of a particular type automatically, using annotation rules, you can assign annotations to an individual asset by using its asset page.

== Before you begin

You must have created the annotation you want to assign.

== Steps

. Log in to the OnCommand Insight web UI.
. Locate the asset to which you want to apply the annotation by doing either of the following:
 ** Click the asset in the Assets Dashboard.
 ** Click image:../media/icon-sanscreen-magnifying-glass-gif.gif[] on the toolbar to display the *Search assets* box, type the type of or name of the asset, and then select the asset from the list that displays.
+
The asset page displays.
. In the *User Data* section of the asset page, click image:../media/add-annotation-icon.gif[].
+
The Add Annotation dialog box displays.

. Click *Annotation* and select an annotation from the list.
. Click *Value* and do either of the following, depending on type of annotation you selected:
 ** If the annotation type is list, date, or Boolean, select a value from the list.
 ** If the annotation type is text, type a value.
. Click *Save*.
. If you want to change the value of the annotation after you assign it, click image:../media/change-annotation-value.gif[] and select a different value.
+
If the annotation is of list type for which the *Add values dynamically upon annotation assignment* option is selected, you can type to add a new value in addition to selecting an existing value.
