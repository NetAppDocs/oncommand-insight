You can assign applications running in your environment to certain assets (host, virtual machines, volumes, internal volumes, and hypervisors). The User Data section enables you to change the application assigned to an asset or assign an application or additional applications to an asset.

== Steps

. Log in to the OnCommand Insight web UI.
. Locate an asset page by doing either of the following:
 ** On the Insight toolbar, click image:../media/icon_sanscreen_magnifying_glass_gif.gif[], type in the name of the asset, and then select the asset from the list.
 ** Click *Dashboards*, select *Assets Dashboard*, locate an asset name, and click it.
The asset page displays.
. You can do the following:
 ** To view the asset page for the application, click the application's name.
 ** To change the application assigned or to assign an application or additional applications, position your cursor over the application name, if an application is assigned, or over *None*, if no application is assigned, click image:../media/pencil_icon_landing_page_be.gif[], type to search for an application or select one from the list, and then click image:../media/check_box_ok.gif[].
+
If you choose an application that is associated with a business entity, the business entity is automatically assigned to the asset. In this case, when you place your cursor over the business entity name, the word _derived_ displays. If you want to maintain the entity for only the asset and not the associated application, you can manually override the assignment of the application.

 ** To remove an application, click image:../media/trash_can_query.gif[].
