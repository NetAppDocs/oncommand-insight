When you are adding a data source, you can verify the correctness of configuration to communicate with the device before saving or updating that data source.

When you click the *Test* button in the data source wizard, communication with the specified device is checked. The test produces one of these results:

* PASSED: the data source is configured correctly.
* WARNING: the testing was incomplete, probably due to timing out during processing or acquisition not running.
* FAILED: the data source, as configured, cannot communicate with the specified device. Check your configuration settings and re-test.
