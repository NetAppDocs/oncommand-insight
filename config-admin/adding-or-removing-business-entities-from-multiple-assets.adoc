You can assign business entities to or remove business entities from multiple assets by using a query instead of having to manually assign or remove them.

== Before you begin

You must have already created the business entities you want to add to your desired assets.

== Steps

. Create a new query, or open an existing query.
. If desired, filter for the assets to which you want to add business entities.
. Select the desired assets in the list or click image:../media/select-assets.gif[] to select *All*.
+
The *Actions* button displays.

. To add a business entity to the selected assets, click image:../media/actions-button.gif[]. If the selected asset type can have business entities assigned to it, you will see the menu choice to *Add Business Entity*. Select this.
. Select the desired business entity from the list and click *Save*.
+
Any new business entity you assign overrides any business entities that were already assigned to the asset. Assigning applications to assets will also override the business entities assigned in the same way. Assigning business entities to as asset may also override any applications assigned to that asset.

. To remove a business entity assigned to the assets, click image:../media/actions-button.gif[] and select *Remove Business Entity*.
. Select the desired business entity from the list and click *Delete*.
