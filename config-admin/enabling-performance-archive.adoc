To enable performance data archiving, follow these steps.

== Steps

. On the toolbar, click *Admin* > *Setup*.
. Select the *Backup & Archive* tab.
. In the Performance Archive section, ensure**Enable performance archive** is checked.
. Specify a valid archive location.
+
You cannot specify a folder under the Insight installation folder.

Best Practice: Do not specify the same folder for archive as the Insight backup location.

. Click *Save*.
+
The archive process is handled in the background and does not interfere with other Insight activities.
