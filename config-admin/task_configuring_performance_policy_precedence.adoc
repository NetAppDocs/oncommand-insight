By default, Insight evaluates an object's policies sequentially. You can configure the order in which Insight evaluates performance policies. For example, if you have a policy configured to stop processing when a violation occurs for Gold Tier storage, you can place that policy first in the list and avoid seeing more generic violations for the same storage asset.

== Steps

. Open Insight in your browser.
. From the *Manage* menu, select *Performance Policies*.
+
The Performance Policies page displays.

. Hover your cursor over a policy name in an object type's performance policy list.
+
The precedence arrows appear to the right of the policy.

. To move a policy up in the list, click the up arrow; to move a policy down in the list, click the down arrow.
+
By default, new policies are added sequentially to an object's list of policies.
