After defining applications with or without business entities, you can associate the applications with assets.

== Steps

. Log in to the OnCommand Insight web UI.
. Locate the asset (host, virtual machine, volume, or internal volume) to which you want to apply the application by doing either of the following:
 ** Click *Dashboard*, select *Assets Dashboard*, and click the asset.
 ** Click image:../media/icon-sanscreen-magnifying-glass-gif.gif[] on the toolbar to display the *Search assets* box, type the name of the asset, and then select the asset from the list.
. In the *User Data* section of the asset page, position your cursor over the name of the application currently assigned to the asset (if there is no application assigned, *None* displays instead) and then click image:../media/pencil-icon-landing-page-be.gif[] (Edit application).
+
The list of available applications for the selected asset display. The applications that are currently associated with the asset are preceded by a check mark.

. You can type in the Search box to filter the application names, or you can scroll down the list.
. Select the applications you want to associate with the asset.
+
You can assign multiple applications to host, virtual machine, and internal volume; however, you can only assign one application to volume.

. Click image:../media/check-box-ok.gif[] to assign the selected application or applications to the asset.
+
The application names appear in the User Data section; if the application is associated with a business entity, the name of the business entity appears in this section also.
