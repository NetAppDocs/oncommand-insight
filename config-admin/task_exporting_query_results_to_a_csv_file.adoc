You might want to export the results of a query into a .CSV file to import the data into another application.

== Steps

. Log in to the OnCommand Insight web UI.
. Click *Queries* and select *Show all queries*.
+
The Queries page is displayed.

. Click a query.
. Click image:../media/export_to_csv.gif[] to export query results to a``.CSV`` file.
. Do one of the following:
 ** Click *Open with* and then *OK* to open the file with Microsoft Excel and save the file to a specific location.
 ** Click *Save file* and then *OK* to save the file to your Downloads folder.
Only the attributes for the displayed columns will be exported. Some displayed columns, particularly those that are part of complex nested relationships, are not exported.

+
[NOTE]
====
When a comma appears in an asset name, the export encloses the name in quotes, preserving the asset name and the proper .csv format.
====
+
When exporting query results, be aware that *all* rows in the results table will be exported, not just those selected or displayed on the screen, up to a maximum of 10,000 rows.
+
[NOTE]
====
When opening an exported .CSV file with Excel, if you have an object name or other field that is in the format NN:NN (two digits followed by a colon followed by two more digits), Excel will sometimes interpret that name as a Time format, instead of Text format. This can result in Excel displaying incorrect values in those columns. For example, an object named "81:45" would show in Excel as "81:45:00".     To work around this, import the .CSV into Excel using the following steps:
+
....
-   Open a new sheet in Excel.
-   On the "Data" tab, choose "From Text".
-   Locate the desired .CSV file and click "Import".
-   In the Import wizard, choose "Delimited" and click Next.
-   Choose "Comma" for the delimiter and click Next.
-   Select the desired columns and choose "Text" for the column data format.
-   Click Finish.
Your objects should show in Excel in the proper format.
