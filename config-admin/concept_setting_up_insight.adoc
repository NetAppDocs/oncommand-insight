To set up Insight, you must activate Insight licenses, set up your data sources, define users and notifications, enable backups, and perform any required advanced configuration steps.

After the OnCommand Insight system is installed, you must perform these setup tasks:

* Install your Insight licenses.
* Set up your data sources in Insight.
* Set up user accounts.
* Configure your email.
* Define your SNMP, email, or syslog notifications if needed.
* Enable automatic weekly backups of your Insight database.
* Perform any advanced configuration steps required, including defining annotations and thresholds.
