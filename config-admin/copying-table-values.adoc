You can copy values in tables for use in search boxes or other applications.

== About this task

There are two methods you can use to copy values from tables or query results.

== Steps

. Method 1: Highlight the desired text with the mouse, copy it, and paste it into search fields or other applications.
. Method 2: For single-value fields whose length exceeds the width of the table column, indicated by ellipses (...), hover over the field and click the clipboard icon. The value is copied to the clipboard for use in search fields or other applications.
+
Note that only values that are links to assets can be copied. Note also that only fields that include single values (i.e. non-lists) have the copy icon.
