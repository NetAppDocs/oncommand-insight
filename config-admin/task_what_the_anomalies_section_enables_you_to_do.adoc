The Anomalies section, which displays only on an application asset page, provides insight into the application infrastructure and enables you to identify abnormal behaviors that could result in service disruptions.

== Steps

. Turn anomaly monitoring on for the desired application and allow it to collect data.
. While the anomaly detection engine is running, you can view the following information in the *Anomalies* section of the application asset page:
 ** The anomaly detection score is shown by a blue bar, representing a score between 0 and 100. Scoring is performed resource-by-resource and counter-by-counter resulting in an overall significance score for the entire application infrastructure.
 ** Application assets view
+
Located below the anomaly detection score, this shows how all the assets contribute to the current anomaly score. If an asset is not contributing significantly to the anomaly score, it is represented by image:../media/anomaly_score_none.gif[]. If the asset is contributing to the significance of the anomaly score, either 1, 2, or three blue bars appear, for example, image:../media/anomaly_score_contributor.gif[]. The values represented by the number of bars indicate the significance of that asset's contribution to the anomaly score as follows: 1 bar = 1-33; 2 bars = 34-67; 3 bars = 68-100.
+
Assets that are assigned to an application (hosts, virtual machines, volumes, internal volumes, and hypervisors) and also assets in the infrastructure that are somehow connected to the assigned assets (for example, nodes, ports, and so on) contribute to the anomaly detection score. Both assets that contribute and those that do not contribute to the specific anomaly are displayed, because the data from the assigned application resources may flow through them.
+
If there are more than 60 assets of one type, the *More* button displays, which you can click to display the remaining assets. That status of those remaining assets, for example, image:../media/anomaly_more_status.gif[], appears next to the *More* button. This example indicates that of a total of 129 assets not shown, 124 of those assets did not contribute to the anomaly score; however, five of those assets did contribute some level of significance to the anomaly score.

 ** Anomaly graph
+
The anomaly graph displays the highest anomaly score, indicated by the orange circle, for the time range (3 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, 7 days, 30 days, or a custom time range) selected for the application asset page. You can drag your pointer over the chart to see the anomaly scores, indicated by a blue circle, for other points during the time range and then click the blue circle, which will update the application assets view to display the assets that contributed to the score at that point in time.
. To aid you in troubleshooting asset performance, you can add an asset from the application assets view to the expert view chart in the application asset page by doing the following:
 .. Click an asset icon in the applications assets view.
+
The following displays: The name of the asset, which is a hyperlink to its asset page, the metric that contributed to the anomaly, the significance of the asset's contribution, and a button that enables you to add the asset to the expert view chart.

 .. Click image:../media/add_to_expert_view_graph.gif[].

+
The asset is added to the expert view chart.
