If your users want to receive Insight reports in their email accounts, you need to configure your email server to enable this feature.

== Steps

. On the Insight toolbar, click *Admin* and select *Notifications*.
. Scroll down to the *Email* section of the page.
. In the *Server* box, enter the name of your SMTP server in your organization, which is identified using either a hostname or an IP address (_nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn_ format).
+
If you specify a hostname, ensure that the name can be resolved through DNS.

. In the *User name* box, enter your user name.
. In the *Password* box, enter the password for accessing the email server, which is required only if your SMTP server is password-protected. This is the same password that you use to log into the application that lets you read your email. If a password is required, you must enter it a second time for verification.
. In the *Sender email* box, enter the sender email account that will be identified as the sender on all OnCommand Insight reports.
+
This account must be a valid email account within your organization.

. In the *Email signature* box, enter the text that you want to be inserted in every email that is sent.
. In the Recipients box, click image:../media/add_email_recipient_icon.gif[], enter an email address, and click *OK*.
+
To edit an email address, select the address, and click image:../media/edit_recipient_icon.gif[]. To delete an email address, select the address, and click image:../media/delete_recipient_icon.gif[].

. To send a test email to specified recipients, click image:../media/test_email_icon.gif[].
. Click *Save*.
