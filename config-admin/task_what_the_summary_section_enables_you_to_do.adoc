You can view the Summary section to see general information about an asset. Specifically, it is helpful to see if any metrics (for example, memory, capacity, and latency) or any performance policies are cause for concern, which OnCommand Insight indicates by displaying a red circle next to the metric or performance policy.

== Steps

. Log in to the OnCommand Insight web UI.
. Locate an asset page by doing either of the following:
 ** On the Insight toolbar, click image:../media/icon_sanscreen_magnifying_glass_gif.gif[], type in the name of the asset, and then select the asset from the list.
 ** Click *Dashboards*, select *Assets Dashboard*, locate an asset name, and click it.
The asset page displays.

[NOTE]
====
The information that displays in the Summary section depends on the type of asset page you are viewing.
====
. You can click any of the asset links to view their asset pages.
+
For example, if you are viewing a storage node, you can click a link to view the asset page of the storage it is associated with or click to view the asset page of the HA partner.

. You can view the metrics associated with the asset.
+
A red circle next to a metric indicates that you might need to diagnose and resolve potential problems.
+
[NOTE]
====
You may notice that volume capacity might show greater than 100% on some storage assets. This is due to metadata related to the capacity of the volume being part of the consumed capacity data reported by the asset.
====

. If applicable, you can click a performance policy link to view the performance policy or policies associated with the asset.
+
If a red circle appears next to a performance policy, this indicates an asset has crossed the performance policy's defined threshold. You should examine the performance policy to further diagnose the issue.
