When your Insight environment is using a non-default security configuration, you must back up the security configuration and then restore the security configuration after the new software is installed. The security configuration must be restored before the Data Warehouse database backup is restored.

== About this task

You use the `securityadmin` tool to create a backup of the configuration and to restore the saved configuration. For more information, search for `securityadmin` in the OnCommand Insight Documentation Center: http://docs.netapp.com/oci-73/index.jsp
