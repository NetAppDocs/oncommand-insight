After you upgrade, you should ensure that the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process is retrieving data from the OnCommand Insight databases, transforming the data, and saving it into the data marts.

== Steps

. Log in to the Data Warehouse portal at `+https://fqdn/dwh+`.
. From the navigation pane on the left, click *Schedule*.
. Click *Edit schedule*.
. Select *Daily* or *Weekly* from the *Type* list.
+
It is recommended to schedule ETL to run once a day.

. Verify that the time selected is the time at which you want the job to run.
+
This ensures that the build job runs automatically.

. Click *Save*.
