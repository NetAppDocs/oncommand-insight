== Before you begin

If you made changes to reports you want to keep, it is critical that you create a backup before you uninstall Data Warehouse. Uninstalling Data Warehouse permanently deletes all previously collected data and removes all reports, including any newly created or edited reports.

== Steps

. Log in to the Data Warehouse server.
. Ensure that all of the Insight windows on the server are closed.
. To uninstall using Control Panel:
 .. Open *Uninstall a Program* from the control panel and select the OnCommand Insight application for removal. Click *Uninstall* and follow the prompts.
 .. Select the IBM Db2 application for removal. Click *Uninstall* and follow the prompts.
 .. Delete the Db2 install folder (for example _C:\Program Files\IBM\DB2_) to completely remove the Db2 database.
. To uninstall using the provided script:
 .. Navigate to the _<download location>\oci_dwh_uninstall\_ folder and run the _uninstall_oci_dwh.bat_ script.
. Reboot the server.
