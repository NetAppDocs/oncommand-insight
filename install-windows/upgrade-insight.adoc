Normally, an upgrade must be performed on all of the Insight servers (Insight server, Data Warehouse server, Remote acquisition unit). You should always consult the Release Notes for the upgrade requirements for a new release of OnCommand Insight.

Unless otherwise indicated, the requirements and procedures apply to upgrading from Insight 7.x to the current version of Insight. If you are upgrading from a version prior to 7.0, contact your account representative.
