If you created custom reports and you do not have the `.xml` source files for them, then you should back up these reports before the upgrade. You should then copy them to a server other than the Data Warehouse server.

== Steps

. Log in to the Data Warehouse portal at `+https://fqdn/dwh+`.
. On the Data Warehouse toolbar, click image:../media/oci_reporting_portal_icon.gif[] to open the Reporting Portal and log in.
. Select *File* > *Open*.
. Select the folder that the report is located in, select the report, and then click *Open*.
. Select *Tools* > *Copy report to clipboard*.
. Open a text editor, paste the contents of the report, and save the file as `report_name.txt`, where `report _name` is the name of the report.
. Store the reports on a server other than the Data Warehouse server.
