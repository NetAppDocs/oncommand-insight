If antivirus software is active on your system, OnCommand Insight installation fails. You can prevent this problem by disabling the virus scan software before installation.

To prevent an installation failure due to active virus scan software, during the installation of each OnCommand Insight component, you must completely disable all virus scanners. Following installation, the paths used by the Insight component (install, backup, and archiver paths) must be excluded from virus scanning.

Additionally, you must also exclude the IBM/Db2 folder (for example _C:\Program Files\IBM\DB2_) from anti-virus scanning following installation.
