You can open Insight in a supported browser to check the installation. You might also want to check the Insight log files.

When you first open Insight, the license setup page opens. After you enter the license information, you must set up the data sources. See the _OnCommand Insight Configuration and Administration Guide_ for information about entering data source definitions and setting up Insight users and notifications.

If you have experienced installation problems, contact technical support and provide the requested information.
