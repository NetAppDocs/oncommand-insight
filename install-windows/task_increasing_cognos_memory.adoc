Before you restore the Data Warehouse database, you should increase the Java allocation for Cognos from 768 MB to 2048 MB to decrease report generation time.

== Steps

. Open a command prompt window as administrator on the Data Warehouse server.
. Navigate to the `disk drive:\install directory\SANscreen\cognos\c10_64\bin64` directory.
. Type the following command: `cogconfigw`
+
The IBM Cognos Configuration window displays.
+
[NOTE]
====
The IBM Cognos Configuration shortcut application points to `disk drive:\Program Files\SANscreen\cognos\c10_64\bin64\cognosconfigw.bat`. If Insight is installed in the Program Files (space between) directory, which is the default, instead of ProgramFiles (no space), the `.bat` file will not work. If this occurs, right click the application shortcut and change `cognosconfigw.bat` to `cognosconfig.exe` to fix the shortcut.
====

. From the navigation pane on the left, expand *Environment*, expand *IBM Cognos services*, and then click *IBM Cognos*.
. Select *Maximum memory for Tomcat in MB* and change 768 MB to 2048 MB.
. On the IBM Cognos Configuration toolbar, click image:../media/cognos_save_icon.gif[](Save).
