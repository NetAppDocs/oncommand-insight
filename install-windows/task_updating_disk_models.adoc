After upgrading, you should have any updated disk models; however, if for some reason Insight failed to discover new disk models, you can manually update them.

== Before you begin

You must have obtained from technical support the `.zip` file that contains the latest data source patches.

== Steps

. Stop the SANscreen Acq service.
. Navigate to the following directory: `<install directory>\SANscreen\wildfly\standalone\deployments\datasources.war`.
. Move the current `diskmodels.jar` file to a different location.
. Copy the new `diskmodels.jar` file into the `datasources.war` directory.
. Start the SANscreen Acq service.
