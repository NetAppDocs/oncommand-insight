You use queries to associate your annotations with the appropriate assets in your environment. Here, we will associate those tiers with the appropriate assets.

Earlier, we set up annotations for your Tiers. For this example, we will associate tiers with storage pools, and will assume your tier annotations are configured as follows:

|===
| Value| Description| Cost per Gb
a|
Tier 1 SSD
a|
All Flash Array
a|
0.5
a|
Tier 2 SAS
a|
SAS
a|
0.25
a|
Tier 3 SATA
a|
SATA
a|
0.1
|===
Let's search for all SSD disks in your environment, and associate the "`Tier 1 SSD`" annotation with them.

* Log in to Insight as a user with administrative permissions
* Select *Queries* > *+New Query*
* Drop down the *Search for...* field and select *Storage Pool*. A list of all of your storage pools is displayed.
* The *Name* field may not be helpful this time, so let's use another field. Click the *More* drop-down and select "`Least performing disk type`". This field lists the disk types that we are interested in. Enter "`SSD`" in the field and click theimage:../media/check-box-ok.gif[] button. The query results list shows only your SSD storage pools.
* You may filter further by clicking the *More* drop-down and selecting additional fields.
* Select the storage pools you wish to associate with this tier. When all of your desired storage pools are selected, click the *Actions* button and select *Edit annotation*.
* In the *Add Annotation* dialog, select the *Tier* annotation.
* Choose the desired *Value* from the list. For this example, choose "`Tier 1 SSD`".
* Click *Save*.
* If the Tier column is not visible on the Query results page, select it by dropping down the *Columns* button and choosing *Tier*. You should see the appropriate annotation now associated with your assets.
* Save the query by clicking the *Save* button in the upper right corner of the Query page and giving it a unique and explicit name. For example, "`Storage Pools - Tier 1 SSD`".

If you wish to associate the "`Tier 1 SSD`" annotation with other assets, create a new query and follow these steps for each asset type you desire.

Repeat these steps for the assets in each of your remaining tiers.
