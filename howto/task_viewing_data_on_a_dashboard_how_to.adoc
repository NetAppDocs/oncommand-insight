Now that you have your assets annotated and have configured performance policies to alert for violations, you can create dashboards to highlight specific data that you want to target.

== About this task

In this example we will provide a high-level view of dashboard creation by creating a dashboard with a single widget highlighting VM Performance data. You can add as many widgets as you need on a single dashboard, and you can create as many dashboards as you need. Widgets can be resized and moved as desired.

More information on Dashboards and Widgets can be found throughout the OnCommand Insight documentation.

== Steps

. Log in to Insight as a user with administrative permissions.
. From the *Dashboards* menu, select *+New dashboard*.
+
The New dashboard page opens.

. Best practice: Name and save your dashboard as soon as you create it. Click the *Save* button and enter a unique name for the dashboard in the *Name* field. For example "`VM Performance Dashboard`". Click *Save*.
. If necessary, slide the *Edit* switch to "`On`" to enable Edit mode. This allows you to begin adding widgets to your dashboard.
. Click the *+Widgets* button and select *Table* to add a new table widget to the dashboard.
+
The Edit Widget dialog opens.

. In the Name field, delete "`Widget 1`" and enter "`Virtual Machine Performance table`".
. Click the asset type drop-down and change *Storage* to *Virtual Machine*.
+
The table data changes to show all virtual machines in your environment.

. To add additional columns to the table, click the *Columns*image:../media/column_picker_button.gif[] button and select the desired columns, for example__Data Center__, _Storage name_, and _Tier_.You can sort the table by any of these columns.
. You can set filters as needed to highlight the data that is important to you for this dashboard, for example, you might choose to only show only virtual machines with "`Tier 1 - SSD`" annotation. Click the"` + `"button next to *Filter by* and select__Tier__. Click on *Any* and enter "`Tier 1 - SSD`". Click the image:../media/check_box_ok.gif[] button to save the filter.
+
The table now shows only virtual machines in the "`SSD`" tier.

. You can group results by clicking the"` + `" button next to *Group by* and selecting a field to group by, such as Data Center. Grouping is automatically applied to the table.
. When you have customized the widget to your satisfaction, click the *Save* button.
+
The table widget is saved to the dashboard.

. You can resize the widget on the dashboard by dragging the lower-right corner.
. To add more widgets, click the *+Widget* button. Each widget is added to the dashboard when it is saved.
. When you have made all the changes desired, be sure to click *Save* to save the dashboard.
. You can create additional dashboards to highlight different data.
