The following steps compare a single VM's Latency Total to the VMs reporting the Top 10 Latency Total in the entire virtual infrastructure.

== Steps

. Add a widget with a line chart to the to the new dashboard: *Widget* > *Line Chart*
 .. Change the default device to Virtual machine: Click *Storage* > *Virtual machine* > *Latency-total*
+
The widget displays the total Latency, for all VMs, for the default 24 hours in an area chart.

 .. Create a second display in this widget that shows Latency Total averaged for all VMs: *Widget* > *Line chart*
 .. Change the default device to Virtual machine: Click *Storage* > *Virtual machine* > *Latency-Total*
+
The widget displays the Latency total for the default 24 hour period of time using a line chart.

 .. Click *X* on the *Roll up* bar and select *Show* > *Top* > *10*

+
The system displays the Top 10 VMs based on Latency - Total. image:../media/guid-7fe726e3-d15f-438a-9d1f-b02fb2daffe9.gif[]
. Add the VM that you want to compare to the Top 10:
 .. Click *+Add*
 .. Change the default device to Virtual machine: Click *Storage* > *Virtual machine* > *Latency total*
 .. Click *Filter by* > *Name* > *$var1*
. Click *Show legend*

== Results

A legend identifies each of the VMs under analysis. You can easily identify VM_Exchange_1 and determine if it is experiencing latency similar to the top ten VMs in the environment.
