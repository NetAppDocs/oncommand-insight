Widgets in dashboards can be displayed with or without legends.

Legends in widgets can be turned on or off on a dashboard by either of two methods:

. When creating or editing the widget itself, check the Legends checkbox and save the widget.
. With the dashboard in Edit mode, click the Options button on the widget and check the Legends checkbox in the menu.

As you edit and change the data displayed in the widget, the legend for that widget is updated dynamically.

When legends are displayed, if the landing page of the asset indicated by the legend can be navigated to, the legend will display as a link to that asset page.
