OnCommand Insight acquires counters and metrics using names that sometimes differ from data source to data source.

When searching for the right metric or counter for your dashboard widget, keep in mind that the metric you want could be under a different name from the one you are thinking of. While drop-down lists in OnCommand Insight are usually alphabetical, sometimes a term may not show up in the list where you think it should. For example, terms like "raw capacity" and "used capacity" do not appear together in most lists.

Best practice: Use the search feature in fields such as *Filter by* or places like the column selector image:../media/column_picker_button.gif[] to find what you are looking for. For example, searching for "cap" will show all metrics with "capacity" in their names, no matter where it occurs. You can then easily select the metrics you want from that short list.

Here are a few alternative phrases you can try when searching for metrics:
