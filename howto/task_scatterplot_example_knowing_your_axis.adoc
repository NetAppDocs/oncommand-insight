Changing the order of counters in a scatterplot widget changes the axes on which the data is displayed.

== About this task

This example will create a scatter plot that will allow you to see under-performing VMs that have high latency compared to low IOPS.

== Steps

. Create or open a dashboard in edit mode and add a *Scatter Plot Chart* widget.
. Select an asset type, for example, *Virtual Machine*.
. Select the first counter you wish to plot. For this example, select *Latency - Total*.
+
_Latency - Total_ is charted along the X-axis of the chart.

. Select the second counter you wish to plot. For this example, select *IOPS - Total*.
+
_IOPS - Total_ is charted along the Y-axis in the chart. VMs with higher latency display on the right side of the chart. Only the top 100 highest-latency VMs are displayed, because the *Top by X-axis* setting is current.

. Now reverse the order of the counters by setting the first counter to *IOPS - Total* and the second to *Latency - Total*.
+
_Iatency- Total_ is now charted along the Y-axis in the chart, and__IOPS - Tota__l along the X-axis. VMs with higher IOPS now display on the right side of the chart.
+
Note that because we haven't changed the *Top by X-Axis* setting, the widget now displays the top 100 highest-IOPS VMs, since this is what is currently plotted along the X-axis.

. You can choose for the chart to display the Top N by X-axis, Top N by Y-axis, Bottom N by X-axis, or Bottom N by Y-axis. In our final example, the chart is displaying the Top 100 VMs that have the highest _total IOPS_. If we change it to Top by Y-axis, the chart will once again display the top 100 VMs that have the highest _total latency_.

Note that in a scatterplot chart, you can click on a point to open the asset page for that resource.
