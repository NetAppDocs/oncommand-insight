OnCommand Insight integrates with ServiceNow management software to provide greater value than the products have separately.

Using a Python script, Insight can integrate data with ServiceNow, synchronizing the following information:

* Storage asset data for ServiceNow servers
* Host and VM URLs for ServiceNow servers
* Relationships between Hosts/VMs and Storage
