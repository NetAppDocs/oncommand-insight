The Integration SNMP Data Source provides common SNMP configuration properties similar to other SNMP based data sources included with the OnCommand Insight data sources for Brocade and Cisco.

== Before you begin

In order to successfully use the Integration SNMP data source to collect, the following must be true:

* You must have already imported an integration pack you will use for this SNMP data source.
* All target devices share the same credentials.
* All target devices implement the SNMP Objects referenced by the configured integration pack.

== About this task
