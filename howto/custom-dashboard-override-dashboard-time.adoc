You can override the main dashboard time frame setting in individual widgets. These widgets will display data based on their set time frame, not the dashboard time frame.

To override the dashboard time and force a widget to use a its own time frame, in the widget's edit mode set the *Override dashboard time* to *On*, and select a time frame for the widget. *Save* the widget to the dashboard.

The widget will display its data according to the time frame set, regardless of the time frame you select on the dashboard itself.

The time frame you set for one widget will not affect any other widgets on the dashboard.
