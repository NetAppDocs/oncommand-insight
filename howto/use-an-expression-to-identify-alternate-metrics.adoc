You can use expressions to view metrics not provided by the web UI, such as the IOPS that are system overhead generated.

== About this task

You might want use an expression to show total IOPS generated by non-read or non-write operations, such as overhead operations for an internal volume.

== Steps

. Add a widget to the dashboard. Choose *Area chart*.
. Change the default device to Internal volume: Click *Storage* > *Internal volume* > *IOPS Write*
. Click the *Convert to Expression* button.
. The *IOPS - Write* metric is now in the alphabetic variable field "`*a*`".
. In the "`*b*`" variable field, click *Select* and choose *IOPS - Read*.
. In the *Expression* field, type *a + b*. In the *Display* section, choose**Area chart** for the expression.
. In the *Filter by* field, enter the name of the internal volume you are analyzing.
. The *Label* field identifies the expression. Change the label to something meaningful like "`R + W IOPS`".
. Click **+Add**to add a line for total IOPS to the widget.
. Change the default device to Internal volume: Click *Storage* > *Internal volume* > *IOPS Total*
. In the *Filter by* field, enter the name of the internal volume you analyzing.

The chart displays the total IOPS as a line, with the chart showing the combination of read and write IOPS in blue. The gap between 9:30 and 9:45 shows non-read and non-write IO (overhead) operations.
