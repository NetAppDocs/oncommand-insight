Once ServiceNow, Insight and the connector are properly configured, you can synchronize the connector.

== Steps

. Open a cmd prompt and change to the \OCI2SNOW folder.
. Run the following command twice. The first sync updates the items, the second sync updates the relationships: `oci_snow_sync.pyz sync`
. Verify that the Storage Server table in your ServiceNow instance is populated. Open a storage server and verify that resources related to that storage are listed.
