Table widgets allow you to group data for easier display.

== About this task

In this example, we will create a table widget showing all VMs grouped by Data Center.

== Steps

. Create or open a dashboard, and add a *Table* widget.
. Select *Virtual Machine* as the asset type for this widget.
. Click on the Column Selector image:../media/column_picker_button.gif[] and choose _Hypervisor name_ and _IOPS - Total_.
+
Those columns are now displayed in the table.

. Let's disregard any VM's with no IOPS, and include only VMs that have total IOPS greater than 1. Click the *Filter by +* button and select *IOPS - Total*. Click on *Any*, and in the *from* field, type 1. Leave the *to* field empty. Click the check button to apply the filter.
+
The table now shows all VMs with Total IOPS greater than or equal to 1. Notice that there is no grouping in the table. All VMs are shown.

. Glick the *Group by +* button.
+
Because *All* is selected as the grouping method by default, all VMs are moved into a single group named "`All`".

. Above the _IOPS - Total_ column is now a *Roll up* option. The default roll up method is _Avg_. This means that the number shown for the group is the average of all the Total IOPS reported for each VM inside the group. You can choose to roll this column up by _Avg_, _Sum_, _Min_ or _Max_. Each column that you display that contains performance metrics can be rolled up individually.
. Click *All* and select *Hypervisor name*.
+
The VM list is now grouped by Hypervisor. You can expand each hypervisor to view the VMs hosted by it.
